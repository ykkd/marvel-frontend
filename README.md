This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Prerequisite

Before starting this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Marvel Developer API Key**  
   This project requires access to the [Marvel Developer API](https://developer.marvel.com/) to fetch data.  
   Follow these steps to set up your API key:

   - Register at the [Marvel Developer Portal](https://developer.marvel.com/) and create an account.
   - Go to **My Developer Account** and get your **Public Key** and **Private Key**.
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your Next.js project and add the following:

     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_MARVEL_API_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
     NEXT_PUBLIC_MARVEL_API_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
     ```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
